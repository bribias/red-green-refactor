# Red, Green, Refactor Lab

## getName function

create a function that returns the name property of an object.

```js
const spot = { name: 'spot', age: 5, weight: '20 lbs' }
getName(spot) // returns spot
const character = { _id: '5cf5679a915ecad153ab68c9', name: 'Aang' };
getName(character) // returns Aang
```

1. **Write a test**
1. create your function, use bracket notation to get the objects name property
1. pass tests and commit
1. refactor, use dot notation to get the objects name
1. tests stay green, commit
1. refactor, destructure to get the objects name
1. tests stay green, commit
1. refactor, destructure function parameters and return name
1. tests stay green, commit

## copyAndPush function

create a function that returns a new array with all the items in the original array
and a new item pushed to the end.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
copyAndPush(numbers, 4) // return [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

1. **Write a test**
1. create your function, use `push` to add item to array and return array
1. green, commit
1. oops we were supposed to return a copy
1. add another test that makes sure that the original array is unchanged
1. update code, use spread to copy and append
1. green, commit

## capitalizeAndFilter

create a function that takes an array of strings capitalize all strings and filter
out any string that starts with the letter F/f.

1. **Write a test**
1. create a function, use a for loop to get test to pass
1. green, commit
1. refactor, use array methods to instead of a for loop

## fetchQuotes

Use the Futurama Quote API [http://futuramaapi.herokuapp.com](http://futuramaapi.herokuapp.com)
to return a single quote with the format:

```js
{
  name: '...',
  text: '...',
  image: '...'
}
```

How do you handle the randomness? Check out:

* [expect any](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectanyconstructor)

## BONUS: Mocks

* use `jest.mock` to mock `node-fetch` see [Mocking Modules](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#mocking-modules)
  * NOTE: `jest.mock` is not supported when using ESM (read: it doesn't work with the `import ... from ...` syntax). In order to complete this bonus, you'll need to convert back to using CJS syntax for imports (eg. `const something = require('something')`).
  * Make sure to remove `"type": "module"` from `package.json` and switch all your `import ... from ...` statements to `const ... = require(...)`
  * For more info, see [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules#differences-between-esm-and-commonjs) and the related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/10025)
